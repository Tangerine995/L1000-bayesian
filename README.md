The meta data are available from the publication by L1000 group: [GSE70138](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70138) and [GSE92742](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742). They include perturbagen and cell line information associated with signature and instance IDs in the catalogs.

### Data stuctures

The *z*-score catalogs (as HDF5) are compatible with the original catalogs by L1000 group. Each of them contains three datasets, similar to the L1000 catalogs, as follows:

* `/colid` are the signature IDs (Level 5) or instance IDs (Level 4);

* `/rowid` are the names of landmark genes;

* `/data` are the *z*-scores as a matrix.

Each marginal distribution catalog contain the information of peak locations on one plate. It contains four datasets as follows:

* `/colid` are the instance IDs;

* `/rowid` are the names of landmark genes;

* `/peakloc` are the locations of the peaks for calculating likelihood function;

* `/data` are encoded log-likelihoods as a rank-3 array of 16-bit unsigned integers. To retrieve the log-likelihoods, the values should be multiplied by a factor of `-0.001`. Note that they are not normalized.
